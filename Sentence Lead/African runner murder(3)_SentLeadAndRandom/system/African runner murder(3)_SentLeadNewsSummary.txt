Few details, plenty of questions as Pistorius disputes murder charge - CNN.com
Pretoria, South Africa Olympic and Paralympic runner Oscar Pistorius on Sunday canceled his appearance in five upcoming races, days after being charged with murder in the shooting death of his girlfriend in South Africa.
The move is meant to help Pistorius focus on the legal proceedings and "help and support all those involved as they try to come to terms with this very difficult and distressing situation," said Peet Van Zyl of Pistorius' management company, In Site Athlete Management.
The Valentine's Day shooting has stunned South Africa, where Pistorius is a national hero.
