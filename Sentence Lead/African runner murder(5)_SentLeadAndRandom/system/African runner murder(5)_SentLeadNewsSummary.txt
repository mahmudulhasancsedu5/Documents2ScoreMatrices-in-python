South Africa judge lifts travel ban on Oscar Pistorius - CNN.com
Pretoria, South Africa South African track star Oscar Pistorius, charged with murder in the shooting death of girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp, is once more allowed to travel overseas after a judge lifted a bail condition Thursday restricting his movements.
Judge Bert Bam said that Pistorius' passport could be held by his attorney, Barry Roux, instead of the court and that he was entitled to use it to travel outside South Africa.
Bam said he saw no reason why Pistorius "should be forbidden to leave South Africa if invited to compete overseas."
