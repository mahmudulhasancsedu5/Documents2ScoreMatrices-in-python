PRETORIA, South Africa (AP) â€” The head of South African police appointed a new lead investigator Thursday in the Oscar Pistorius premeditated murder case after it came to light that previous murder charges against the detective in question had been reinstated, potentially another damaging blow to the prosecution.
Pistorius says he mistook Steenkamp for an intruder and that the shooting was accidental.
Pistorius, the 26-year-old known as the Blade Runner for his carbon-fiber running prosthetic legs, says he fired shots through the locked door of a toilet enclosed inside his bathroom because he thought there was an intruder in there.
