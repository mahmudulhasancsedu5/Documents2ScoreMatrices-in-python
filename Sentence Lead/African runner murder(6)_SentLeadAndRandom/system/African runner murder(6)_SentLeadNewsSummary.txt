Police: Lead detective in Oscar Pistorius case faces attempted murder charges
PRETORIA, South Africa (AP) â€” The head of South African police appointed a new lead investigator Thursday in the Oscar Pistorius premeditated murder case after it came to light that previous murder charges against the detective in question had been reinstated, potentially another damaging blow to the prosecution.
National Commissioner Riah Phiyega says Lt. Gen. Vinesh Moonoo will take over the investigation.
Phiyega says the Pistorius case "shall receive attention at the national level" and Moonoo will "gather a team of highly skilled and experience detectives."
