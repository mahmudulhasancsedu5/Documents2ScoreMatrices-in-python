The 22-year South African Police veteran is accused of chasing and firing on a minibus full of people while drunk.
Bulelwa Makeke, the spokeswoman for South Africa's National Prosecuting Authority, said before the announcement of Botha's removal that the accusations against the investigator would be little more than a "speed bump" in the Pistorius case.
He argued that police had missed a bullet in the toilet of the bathroom where Steenkamp was shot and may have contaminated the crime scene by failing to wear protective foot covers.
Botha, the first officer on the scene of the Valentine's Day shooting, handed in his resignation Wednesday, Malila said.
