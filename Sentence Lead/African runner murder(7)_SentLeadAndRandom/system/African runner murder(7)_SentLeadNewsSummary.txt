Botha, former Pistorius detective, off police force - CNN.com
Hilton Botha, the former lead detective in the Oscar Pistorius murder case, cited "private reasons" for resigning from the police force, South African Police spokesman Brig.
Neville Malila said Thursday.
Botha was pulled from the Pistorius case last month after prosecutors reinstated attempted murder charges against him in a 2011 case.
