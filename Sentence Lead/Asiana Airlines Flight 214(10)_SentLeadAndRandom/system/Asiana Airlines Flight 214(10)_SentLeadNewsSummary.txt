Investigators sift for reasons for Asiana crash
Federal crash investigators are eager to interview the pilots and review the flight-data recorders that were recovered Saturday from the Asiana Airlines crash in San Francisco.
The cockpit voice recorder and the flight-data recorder were each recovered hours after the crash and flown to Washington, D.C., for examination by the National Transportation Safety Board.
Deborah Hersman, the board chairman who traveled to the accident scene, said the recorders will provide hundreds of pieces of information about the flight in the moments and hours before the crash.
