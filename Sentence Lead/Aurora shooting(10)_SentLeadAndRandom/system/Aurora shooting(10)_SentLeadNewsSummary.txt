Shootings cast pall over 'Dark Knight Rises' blockbuster weekend - CNN.com
The early Friday release of "The Dark Knight Rises" was one of the most eagerly anticipated movie events of the summer.
On Thursday, movie ticket seller Fandango reported that the last installment in the Christopher Nolan-directed Batman trilogy was "outpacing summer blockbuster 'The Avengers' in ticket sales at the same point in the sales cycle."
"The final chapter of Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy has sold out on Fandango more than 2,000 showtimes nationwide and it's currently on track to become one of Fandango's top-selling movies of all time," the ticket seller reported.
