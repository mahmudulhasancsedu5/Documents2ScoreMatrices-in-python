President shares story of hero who tended to friend in theater shooting - CNN.com
Seconds after a gunman shot Allie Young in the neck in a crowded Colorado theater, a friend, Stephanie Davies, pulled her into an aisle, put pressure on her wound and dialed 911.
Young told her friend to run, but Davies refused.
President Barack Obama gave that account Sunday night in Aurora, praising Davies and others for heroism amid chaos and bloodshed in the shooting that killed 12 and wounded 58.
