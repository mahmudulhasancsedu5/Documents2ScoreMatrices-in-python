Colorado hospitals chip in for shooting victims' care - CNN.com
With many patients still being cared for after last week's Colorado movie theater shootings, one burden is being lifted by some of the hospitals: medical expenses.
Children's Hospital Colorado said it will use its charity care program and donations to cover medical expenses for victims of the shooting who do not have insurance.
Victims who do have insurance will have their co-pays and deductible-related expenses waived.
