Pretoria, South Africa Olympic and Paralympic runner Oscar Pistorius on Sunday canceled his appearance in five upcoming races, days after being charged with murder in the shooting death of his girlfriend in South Africa..
"We have sobered up -- even though people will still question why.".
"I'm going to miss you all so much and I love you very very much.".
The allegation was a major fall from grace for a man who made history last year by becoming the first double-amputee runner to compete in the able-bodied Olympic Games in London..
