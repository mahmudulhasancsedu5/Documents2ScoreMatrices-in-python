The IAAF will not comment on the case against Pistorius, he added..
Pistorius should report his itinerary a week before leaving and hand his travel documents back over to his lawyer within 24 hours of returning to South Africa, Bam said at Pretoria's North Gauteng High Court..
The new order represents a victory for the athlete's legal team, which went to court to request more lenient terms for his bail..
Invitations are at the discretion of meeting organizers, not the IAAF, he said..
