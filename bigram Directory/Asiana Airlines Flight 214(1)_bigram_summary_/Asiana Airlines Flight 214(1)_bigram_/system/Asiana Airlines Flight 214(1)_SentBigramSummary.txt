At one point, flights destined for San Francisco International Airport were diverted to airports in Oakland, Sacramento, San Jose and Los Angeles, said Francis Zamora of San Francisco's emergency management department..
He was "10 seconds away from being home" when the airplane dipped "kind of sharp," followed by another adjustment "and then just boom, the back end just hit and flies up in the air and everybody's head goes up to the ceiling.".
While the exact cause will take months to determine, the South Korean Transport Ministry said "the tail of the Asiana flight hit the runway and the aircraft veered to the left out of the runway.".
Some 182 passengers and crew were being treated at Bay Area hospitals, with everything from spinal fractures to bumps and bruises, San Francisco deputy fire chief Dale Carnes said..
