SAN FRANCISCO — Asiana Airlines Flight 214 was traveling well below its target speed for landing when it crashed short of the runway Saturday, National Transportation Safety Board Chairman Deborah Hersman said at a briefing Sunday..
"What we need to do is corroborate the information we have on both the flight data recorder and the cockpit voice recorder" for a complete picture of what happened, she said, but the two devices appeared to "mirror" each other — that anomalies in the data appear to correspond to the pilots' actions..
Hersman said a component of the airport's instrument landing system that tracks the glide path of incoming airplanes was not working at the time of the crash, but other technology aids were available to the pilots on the final approach..
